## Tasks
✅ DONE ❌ NOT DONE 👷 WIP
1. ✅ User React and Typescript.
2. ✅ Do not use any 3rd party component or CSS library.
3. ✅ Add async mock function CREATE, READ, DELETE colors.
4. ✅ There is no need for authentication related functionality.
5. ✅ Please send a Github link with your solution.

### For extra points
1. ✅ The mock calls save the data into localStorage and the Color collection is initialized with the saved data on browser refresh.
2. ✅ Install the app somewhere(and share its URL).
3. ✅ Implement the exact appearance of the design. (I've done my best)
4. ✅ Your solution looks exacly the same on both Chrome and Firefox.
5. ✅ Create a README in your repo and add notes about installation, implementation details or any important info about your solution. 
6. ✅ Add validation: a color name should not be an empty string, color names and color codes must be unique. Too long color names are not allowed.
7. ✅ Handle overflow: if a color name is long it should not overlap with the Remove color button. If the color list is long use scrollbar.
