## Frontend task

## Project info
The app is created with vite. It uses typescript and react. The app is hosted on digital ocean app platform. The app uses the app platforrm auto build and deploy feature on update to the master branch. The app is live at https://theheadhunter.davidilievski.dev/.

To track the state of your color collection, the frontend generates a token for the user and saves it in localStorage. With every api call you send your token to edit and retrieve your collection. The tasks from the frontend (mock functions and validation) are implemented in the backend as the backend tasks state.

## Tasks
✅ DONE ❌ NOT DONE 👷 WIP
1. ✅ User React and Typescript.
2. ✅ Do not use any 3rd party component or CSS library.
3. ✅ Add async mock function CREATE, READ, DELETE colors.
4. ✅ There is no need for authentication related functionality.
5. ✅ Please send a Github link with your solution.

### For extra points
1. ✅ The mock calls save the data into localStorage and the Color collection is initialized with the saved data on browser refresh.
2. ✅ Install the app somewhere(and share its URL).
3. ✅ Implement the exact appearance of the design. (I've done my best)
4. ✅ Your solution looks exacly the same on both Chrome and Firefox.
5. ✅ Create a README in your repo and add notes about installation, implementation details or any important info about your solution. 
6. ✅ Add validation: a color name should not be an empty string, color names and color codes must be unique. Too long color names are not allowed.
7. ✅ Handle overflow: if a color name is long it should not overlap with the Remove color button. If the color list is long use scrollbar.
